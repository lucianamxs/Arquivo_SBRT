Present directory contains real noise recordings made using a laptop and
 a MC391 (Shure) microphone.
Signals were recorded at 44 kHz. The recordings include samples from:

1. Multi-talker babble recorded inside University’s cafeteria (1 sample)
2. Construction site (5 samples)
3. Car (3 samples)
4. Inside commercial airplane (1 sample)
5. Train (3 samples recorded from inside train and 2 from outside)
6. PC fan noise (1 sample)
7. Street noise (2 samples)
8. Water cooler (1 sample)

In addition, speech-shaped noise (SSN_IEEE.wav) was created by filtering 
white noise through a bandpass filter with frequency response matching
 the long-term average spectrum of the talker in the IEEE corpus 
accompanying the CD of the book. In other words, the long-term average 
spectrum of the speech-shaped noise matches the long-term average spectrum
of the male talker in the IEEE corpus.
